Why LabelLens?

Regulatory compliance and safety checks for the modern consumer.

Instant Decoding

Our OCR identifies E-numbers (e.g., E102, INS 211) and hidden chemical names instantly.

BIS & FSSAI Checks

See which additives are permitted, restricted, or require warning labels under Indian regulations.

Transparency Score

We rate the label's clarity. Vague terms like "flavours" or "edible oil" lower the score.
